# Garbage Classification using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
Garbage classification is essential for efficient waste management and environmental sustainability. 

This project focuses on building an AI-based model that can automatically classify images of garbage into various categories such as *organic, *recyclable*, *electronic waste*, *hazardous*, *Plastic*, *glass*, etc.

The aim is to assist municipal corporations and waste management companies in sorting waste more efficiently using machine learning and computer vision.

##  Problem Statement
Improper segregation of waste leads to increased pollution, landfill overload, and poor recycling rates. Manual sorting is time-consuming, inefficient, and unhygienic.

This project proposes an image classification model trained on labeled garbage images to identify the type of waste automatically, making the process faster, more accurate, and scalable.
